*Figure 1: Overview of the proposed framework.*

## Abstract

Accurate prediction of synthetic lethality (SL) is important for guiding the development of cancer drugs and therapies. SL prediction faces significant challenges in effectively fusing heterogeneous multi-source data.
Existing multimodal methods often suffer from "modality laziness" due to disparate convergence speeds, 
which hinders the exploitation of complementary information and causes most SL prediction models to perform poorly for both pan-cancer and single-cancer SL pair predictions. In this study, we propose SynLeaF, a dual-stage multimodal fusion framework for SL prediction in pan-cancer and single-cancer contexts. 
The framework employs a VAE-based cross-encoder with a Product of Experts mechanism to fuse four omics data types 
(gene expression, mutation, methylation, and CNV), 
simultaneously utilizing a relational graph convolutional network to capture structured gene representations from biomedical knowledge graphs. 
To mitigate modality laziness, SynLeaF introduces a dual-stage training mechanism that employs a feature-level knowledge distillation. 
In extensive experiments across eight specific cancer types and a pan-cancer dataset, 
SynLeaF achieved superior performance in 17 of the 19 scenarios.
Ablation studies and gradient analyses further validate the critical contributions 
of the proposed fusion and distillation mechanisms for model robustness and generalization.
To facilitate community use, a web server is available at [https://synleaf.bioinformatics-lilab.cn](https://synleaf.bioinformatics-lilab.cn).

2. After extraction, retrieve the following files, rename them, and place them in `/data_raw/TCGA/BRCA`:
    - `data_mrna_seq_v2_rsem_zscores_ref_all_samples.txt` -> **exp.txt**

## Data Preprocessing

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All Python scripts must be run within the `src` directory. Please execute `cd src` first.

### TL;DR
If you prefer not to preprocess data manually, you can download the packaged processed data [`data.tar.gz`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TV3Rxdr3q-ZjliAsouDTMpHGI30yaHUr/view?usp=sharing) from the cloud storage and extract it to the project root directory.

### Step 1: Base Data Generation
Run the following command, which will generate some necessary data and the raw SL samples for 8 types of cancers from ELISL.
```bash
python preprocess_pre.py
```
*If you need to train on other cancers, please manually add data to `data_raw/SL/ANOTHER_CANCER.csv` (refer to the other cancer dataset for format).*

### Step 2: Generate Training Data
Generate training status data for specific cancers.

**Specific Cancers:**
```bash
python preprocess_main.py \
    --ct BRCA CESC COAD KIRC LAML LUAD OV SKCM \
    --cn_kg "breast cancer" "cervical cancer" "colon cancer" "kidney cancer" "hematologic cancer" "lung cancer" "ovarian cancer" "skin cancer"
```

``--cn_kg`` is the list of entity names of `Disease` in SLKG 2.0, corresponding to a list of cancers (`--ct`).

All supported values in ``cn_kg`` are provided in the `misc/supported_cn_kg.txt` folder. If there is no cancer you want, use `EMPTY` instead. 

**Pan-Cancer:**
```bash
python preprocess_main.py \
    --ct pan \
    --cn_kg TOTAL \
    --omics_types cna exp mut
```

*(Note: To ensure consistency in experimental results, it is recommended to copy and run the above commands directly)*

### Step 3: K-Fold Cross-Validation Split
Generate 5-Fold split data for Pan-cancer and 8 specific cancers at once.
```bash
python preprocess_folder.py \
    --ct BRCA CESC COAD KIRC LAML LUAD OV SKCM pan
```

## Training & Evaluation

### 1. Accelerate Configuration
Please modify `accelerate_config.yaml` according to your hardware.
*   Recommended configuration: **2 GPUs** (to match our experimental environment).

### 2. Single Fold Training
Modify parameters in `train.py` and run:
```bash
accelerate launch --config_file ../accelerate_config.yaml train.py
```

### 3. Parallel Training
Use `scheduler.py` for multi-card parallel scheduling. Please configure the ``single_card_memory`` and ``card_groups`` parameters according to your specific hardware environment.

**Execution Flow:**

1.  **Stage 1: Single-modal Pre-training**
    ```bash
    nohup python -u scheduler.py \
        --task_types only_omics only_kg \
        > scheduler_1.log 2>&1 &
    ```

2.  **Stage 2: Multimodal Joint Training**
    ```bash
    nohup python -u scheduler.py \
        --task_types umt ume \
        > scheduler_2.log 2>&1 &
    ```

3.  **Result Statistics**
    ```bash
    python analysis.py
    ```
